                            <p>There are Key/Domain-Specific Attributes specifying his characteristics and actions (which are closely related to the design goal), Goals outlining what he wanted to achieve, and a Quote reflecting his general attitude and
                                temperament. The Personal Profile is a simple summary reflecting my understanding of his character. </p>
                            <p>After creating the Persona, I gained a much more concrete, vivid understanding about a user's characteristics at play in a situation, as well as his intentions and habits. </p>

                            <p>I used Sketch to depict the Journey Map of the father and his children's overall dinner preparation experience. I organized the journey map into three parts: </p>

                                <li>Actions: general behavior and major actions of the father </li>
                                <li>Interactions: interaction between the father and his kids or objects </li>
                                <li>Thoughts &amp; Emotions: description of the thoughts, intentions, and words of the father individually or with his children </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I also indicated the various appliances and emotional states in the highlighted words. </p>

                            <p>The final step of the assignment was to identify opportunities for improvement, which includes: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>User is the person we are designing for - in this case, the father. </li>
                                <li>Need is the primary needs of the person. </li>
                                <li>Insight is the chance for design to come in, and should not be described too rigidly, which would limit the range of ideas. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After identifying areas for change, I was able to come up with five different solutions to improve the father's dinner preparing experience. </p>

                            <p>It is not enough to only be aware of what people say and feel; you should also make the effort to make sense of that data. In this assignment, I learned how to interpret user needs and wants from raw information in a step-by-step
                                manner. After creating the Persona, I gained a deeper understanding about the user and his wants and needs. The journey map also provided a thorough method with which to outline a process in sequence, instead of separate
                                activities. Lastly, the Opportunity Area provided a framework for me to come up with various solutions to help smooth tangles out. </p>
